"""
This module aims at identifying cavities. It contains a modified
version of the LigSiteCS algorithm
The protein is projected onto a cubic regular 3D grid (cf gridtools.py).
Since the grid is regular, most of the work is not made in the Cartesian 3D space, but 
is projected on the indices of the grid (a mathematical rule can be made to identify
the indices of the neighbors of a certain index point of the grid).
Characteristics of the grid points are projected in an array, grid_decomposition.
This array contains n values (corresponding to indices of grid points, of length
size of the grid), which are either 0 (solvent grid point), 1 (protein grid point)
or >=2 (potential cavity grid point). Grid points that fall within the van der Waals +
probe volume of the protein are labelled as "protein", ie, "1".
This is the function "find_protein_points_variablevolume". A file contains the information
on the size of protein atoms. At this stage, grid points are either tagged as 0 or as 1.
Then, each "0" grid point (solvent) undergoes an evaluation of its burial.
The neighboring grid points around the grid point of interest are checked. The algorithm
works in a cubic fashion, ie, points in the 14 cubic directions around the point
of interest are investigated up to a certain number of cubes around said grid points.
If a protein grid point (ie, "1") is found in one of the 14 directions within "radius_cube",
the burial is incremented by one and the next direction is investigated.
That gives a burial between 0 (no protein grid point within radius_cube around the grid point
of interest) and 14 (protein grid points are found in the 14 directions around the grid point
of interest within radius_cube). The function performing this task is "set_burial_scandir_np".
Grid points that have a burial >= min_burial (9 by default) are kept as potential grid points.
A second pass is made within the same function. If a cavity is large, it can very well be that 
some cavity grid points "in the middle of the cavity" are not in direct contact with the protein,
but enclosed enough within cavity grid points and should be part of the cavity. This scenario is 
investigated using the same rational than aforementioned, except that instead of checking if a
solvent point is in contact with the protein in cubic directions, here, its contact with cavity
grid points ("2") is checked, within "cube_radius_enc" and "min_burial_enc".
At the end, the indices of grid points with a buriedness >= min_burial in grid_decomposition 
are assigned values between min_burial and 14 (their buriedness), or 2 ("middle cavity points")
(in opposition to 0 for solvent and 1 for protein)

This data is then fed into a graph, for which nodes are potential cavity grid points,
and edges are built between cavity grid points that are in cubic contact. Bridges in the graph, self
loops, as well as nodes that are not well connected (min_degree = 3) are excluded.
Only cavities of size > min_points (80 by default ~ volume of benzene) are ultimately retained.

The final function filter_cavities calculates a cavity score:
(size_cav/100)*(median buriedness)*(7th quantile of buriedness value)/100
in order to rank cavities. It also filters out cavities that have fewer than X% (30% within quantile = 0.7) grid points 
with a buriedness >= min_burial_q = 11 and prints out information (size of the cavity in grid points, median
buriedness, 7th quantile of buriedness, score)
